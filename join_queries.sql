-- =======================
-- ðŸ”„ INNER JOIN
-- =======================
-- This will return only the students who are enrolled in a course that exists in the Courses table.
-- Students with NULL CourseID or unmatched CourseIDs will be excluded.
SELECT s.Name AS StudentName, c.CourseName
FROM Students s
INNER JOIN Courses c ON s.CourseID = c.CourseID;

-- =======================
-- ðŸ”„ LEFT JOIN
-- =======================
-- This will return all students, even if they are not enrolled in a course.
-- If there's no matching CourseID, CourseName will show as NULL.
-- Good for finding students not assigned to any valid course.
SELECT s.Name AS StudentName, c.CourseName
FROM Students s
LEFT JOIN Courses c ON s.CourseID = c.CourseID;

-- =======================
-- ðŸ”„ RIGHT JOIN
-- =======================
-- This will return all courses, even if no student is enrolled in them.
-- If no student is found for a course, StudentName will show as NULL.
-- Useful to identify courses with no enrollment.
SELECT s.Name AS StudentName, c.CourseName
FROM Students s
RIGHT JOIN Courses c ON s.CourseID = c.CourseID;

-- =======================
-- ðŸ”„ FULL OUTER JOIN (via UNION)
-- =======================
-- MySQL does not support FULL OUTER JOIN directly, so we simulate it using UNION of LEFT and RIGHT joins.
-- This will return:
-- - Students with or without a course
-- - Courses with or without students
-- Ensures that nothing is missed on either side.
